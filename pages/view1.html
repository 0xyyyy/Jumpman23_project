            <p>
                The following is an analysis of the pickup and dropoff patterns for Jumpman23.
            </p>
            <h4>Order Time</h4>
            <p>
                In order to grow our userbase and drive repeat business with existing customers we must ensure a smooth user experience. To this end I looked at 
                how long it takes for users to place an order once they've started using the app.
            </p>

                    <li id="styled2">% of orders that are outliers:<br> 7%</li>

            <p>
                Although average order time is relatively low, it is alarming that such a high percentage of orders lie within the outlier range. This could indicate an issue with the 
                user interface. In order to reduce the amount of idle time spent on the app we could implement a popular restaurants category as well as using information from the users past orders to 
                suggest restaurants.

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h4>Prep Time, Transit Time, and Total Order Time</h4>
            <p>
                Moving on from User interface concerns, the next area for improvement is order fulfillment time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Average order time is around 45 minutes with a greater portion of this time spent prepping the food. In order to reduce lag between jumpmen arriving at the pickup location
                and leaving the pickup location, restaurants with high order volume should prep food ahead of time in order to meet demand. To get a better understanding of the types of vehicles
                Jumpmen are using to fulfill orders I decided to look into popular modes of transportation.

            <h4>Fleet Analysis</h4>

                    The NYC fleet consists overwhelmingly of bicycles, with cars trailing behind and other modes of transportation being negligible.
                </p>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12">

                <p>
                    According to the distance travelled by vehicle type it appears that the app needs to do a better job differentiating between vehiclee types when assigning Jumpmen to orders.

            <h4>Pickup and Dropoff Hotspots</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Looking at the pickup and dropoff heatmaps below, we see that pickup locations are fairly centralized in lower Manhattan while dropoff locations are more disparate.
            </p>
            <b>Pickup Heatmap:</b>

            <b>Dropoff Heatmap:</b>

            <br>
            <img src="/Jumpman23/images/dropoff_heatmap.png" alt="dropoff_heatmap"><br>
            <p>
                Improving the algorithm which matches jumpmen to customers could help to improve the latency to fulfilling orders especially for customers that live well outside of hotspot pickup areas.
